## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- ‚úÖ Store in environment variables
- ‚úÖ Never commit to version control
- ‚úÖ Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)
- ‚úÖ Use separate keys for dev/staging/production

### Input Validation
- ‚úÖ Validate request JSON format
- ‚úÖ Limit message length (max 500 characters)
- ‚úÖ Sanitize user input to prevent prompt injection
- ‚ùå **Not implemented:** Rate limiting per user/IP

### Output Safety
- ‚úÖ Plain text responses (no executable code)
- ‚úÖ Context-specific system prompts
- ‚úÖ Error messages don't expose internals
